# Blank Cheat Menu
All credits to @Nanquitas for CTRPluginFramework Lib

## What is this?
* A blank menu that is written in C++ to write cheat codes for Nintendo 3DS games using either [NTR CFW](https://github.com/44670/BootNTR/releases) or [Luma's Plugin](https://gbatemp.net/threads/ctrpluginframework-blank-plugin-now-with-action-replay.487729/) loading. 
* The possibilities are limitless as to what you can write in this plugin! The limit is your brain or the 3DS hardware :^)

### How to compile

To compile follow these steps:
* Make sure you have the latest verion of [DevkitPro](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/) and then clone this repo.
* Open terminal and then run ```cd (directory of cheat menu)```
* Run ```make clean``` if it's your first time compiling the project. For other times, just run `make`
* If there are any compilation errors, the command window will tell you where they are, and then you fix them.
